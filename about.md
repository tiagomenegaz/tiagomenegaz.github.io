I have a Bachelor in Computer Science from [PUC Minas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Minas_Gerais) and [UWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia). 

With over than 8 years of experience building products and applications across the world with distributed teams, I specialize in developing diverse applications, from monolithic architectures to microservices, using technologies like Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Docker, Ruby on Rails, and Flask. Additionally, throughout those years, I have worked in a wide variety of projects such as data pipelines, database design and architecture, serverless jobs, web scrapers, open source projects, and more.

I'm passionate about collaborative development and clean code, focusing on delivering high-quality solutions that drive business impact. Letâ€™s connect to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to building impactful tools.
